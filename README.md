# Github Repository Search & Listing
AngularJS technical test for Thortful that uses the Github API to search and return details on repositories

## Future Improvements 
- Would like to use 'keyup' method for searching rather than hitting Return to submit form, unfortunately there's a fairly low limit on Github's API hourly requests so this wouldn't be possible at this time as every keypress would trigger an API call. 
- Display issue comments and replies in organised list
- Display contents of README.md file on single repo view
- Share options to share results with friends/social networks
- Use HTML5 History API to allow browser back/forward buttons
- URL rewriting with repository name
- Futher & more in depth unit tests
- IE8 support
